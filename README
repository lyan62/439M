In this project, following classifers are implemented for face recognition
1. MLE with Gaussian assumption followed by Bayes rule
2. K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) rule
3. PCA followed by KNN and Bayes rule
4. LDA followed by KNN and Bayes rule


To run the code,
1.go to location: "/wenyanli_P1/Code" 

2. choose dataset:

Using dataset 1(DATA):
in matlab command window, type >>> test_expression
OR  
>>>   test_illum
OR
>>>   test_neutral

will give classification results using different training data.


Using dataset2(POSE):
in matalab command window, type >>> test_dataset2

Using dataset3(ILLUMINATION):
in matlab command window, type >>> test_dataset3
